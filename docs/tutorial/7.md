## 7 - Changing configuration

This assumes you're still running the local LXC JXaaS, as in step 5 & 6

We should still have the mysql instance we've been playing with:

```
jxaas connect mysql m1
```

You can see that the JXaaS instances have configuration, just like Juju charms:

```
bin/jxaas get-options mysql m1
```

In fact, usually most of these configuration values map directly to a Juju charm setting.  But sometime
that isn't appropriate for an XaaS environment, so not all of them map directly.

We're going to change the (new) slow-query-time parameter on the MySQL charm.  If you want, you can check
that it is still set to the default (-1) in Juju:

```
juju get utenant1-mysql-m1-mysql | grep -A5 slow-query-time
```

You can also connect to MySQL and verify that the setting is off:

```
jxaas connect mysql m1

show variables like 'slow_query_log';
```

Now, through JXaaS, set the configuration value:

```
jxaas set-option mysql m1 slow-query-time 0.1
```

You can verify that JXaas passed this through to Juju:

```
jxaas set-option mysql slow-query-time 0.1
```

And that it is now set in MySQL:
```
jxaas connect mysql m1

show variables like 'slow_query_log';
```


If you're using a proxy charm, you can set the property through Juju on the proxy charm,
the proxy charm passes it to JXaaS, which sets the property on the Juju charm providing
the service.
