## 8 - Repair & Auto-repair

If you're running a large XaaS service, that could involve a lot of operations work.

JXaaS can help with some of the basic stuff.  For example, the MySQL manifest specifies that the
mysql init.d service should always be running.

We can test this by creating a MySQL instance, and then injecting a fault.  JXaaS will quickly
auto-repair the fault:

```
jxaas create-instance mysql tutorial8

jxaas wait mysql tutorial8
```

Now inject a fault (pretend MySQL crashed):
```
juju ssh uadmin-mysql-tutorial8-mysql/0 sudo service mysql stop
```

Connecting to the mysql instance will now fail:

```
# This will now fail...
jxaas connect mysql tutorial8
```

Wait until service is auto-repaired ... up to 1 minute.

```
jxaas connect mysql tutorial8
```


If you'd rather not wait, you can also query the health status directly;
along with directly forcing a repair:

```
juju ssh uadmin-mysql-tutorial8-mysql/0 sudo service mysql stop

jxaas get-health mysql tutorial8
jxaas repair-instance mysql tutorial8
jxaas get-health mysql tutorial8
```


# Summary

JXaaS can monitor the health of an instance, and repair it on-demand.  It also automatically detects faults
and fixes them periodically.  If you're running a large number of XaaS services, this can save a lot of operations
works.
