## 8 - Repair & Auto-repair

```
juju ssh utenant1-mysql-m1-mysql/0 sudo service mysql stop

# This will now fail...
# jxaas connect mysql m1
```

Wait until service is auto-repaired ... up to 1 minute.

```
jxaas connect mysql m1
```


If you'd rather not wait, you can also query the health status directly;
along with directly forcing a repair:

```
juju ssh utenant1-mysql-m1-mysql/0 sudo service mysql stop

jxaas get-health mysql m1
jxaas repair-instance mysql m1
jxaas get-health mysql m1
```
