## 3 - Running on EC2

Let's run a real XaaS: running on EC2.  Each instance will be assigned its own EC2 instance.

For EC2, the big gotcha is that instances must be able to reach JXaaS.  So you can't
run JXaaS on your laptop and have instance reach it.  We need to run JXaaS on EC2.

Set up Juju with EC2 as normal.

Then add JXaaS to machine #0 (it doesn't have to be the same machine, but this means we
don't consume an extra machine):
```
juju deploy --to 0 cs:~justin-fathomdb/trusty/jxaas jxaas
```

Now we need to set the admin secret:

```
grep admin-secret ~/.juju/environments/amazon.jenv | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '
```

That should print your admin secret, which is the password for the Juju API.

We need to set that on JXaaS:

```
API_SECRET=`grep admin-secret ~/.juju/environments/amazon.jenv | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
juju set jxaas api-password=${API_SECRET}
```

Now make sure that JXaaS is exposed (NOTE: this isn't really safe yet, because
we're not yet using real authentication):

```
juju expose jxaas
```

Now let's try it out:

```
PUBLIC_ADDRESS=`juju status jxaas | grep public-address | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
echo "PUBLIC_ADDRESS is ${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}"
export JXAAS_URL=http://${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}:8080/xaas

jxaas list-instances mysql

jxaas create-instance mysql m4

jxaas list-instances mysql
```


Eventually, this should move into the started state (you can also watch juju status).

Then you should try:

```
jxaas connect-instance mysql m4
```
