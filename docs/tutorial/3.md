## 3 - Running on EC2

Let's run a real XaaS: running on EC2.  Each instance will be assigned its own EC2 instance.

For EC2, the big gotcha is that instances must be able to reach JXaaS.  So you can't
run JXaaS on your laptop and have instance reach it.  We need to run JXaaS on EC2.

Set up Juju with EC2 as normal.  I recommend doing this on an EC2 instance, because it makes the
next step much more interesting (but you don't have to!)

Whether on an EC2 instance or locally, go through the normal routine for EC2 installation:
```
sudo apt-get install --yes juju juju-local

juju generate-config

# Add your EC2 access-key and secret-key
vi ~/.juju./environments.yaml

juju bootstrap

juju status
```

Then add JXaaS to machine #0 (it doesn't have to be the same machine, but this means we
don't consume an extra machine).  This uses the charm, which uses a pre-compiled version of
jxaas (from S3), so you don't need to build it:
```
juju deploy --to 0 cs:~justin-fathomdb/trusty/jxaas jxaas
```

(Note that if you're running on LXC, it won't allow you to deploy to the same machine (?) (and you probably
aren't as concerned about any cost savings, either!), so you won't be able to use ```-to 0```)

Now we need to set the admin secret:

```
grep admin-secret ~/.juju/environments/amazon.jenv | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '
```

That should print your admin secret, which is the password for the Juju API.

We need to set that on JXaaS:

```
API_SECRET=`grep admin-secret ~/.juju/environments/amazon.jenv | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
juju set jxaas "api-password=${API_SECRET}"
```

Now make sure that JXaaS is exposed (NOTE: this isn't really safe yet, because
we're not yet using real authentication):

```
juju expose jxaas
```

Now let's try it out:

```
PUBLIC_ADDRESS=`juju status jxaas | grep public-address | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
echo "PUBLIC_ADDRESS is ${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}"
export JXAAS_URL=http://${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}:8080/xaas
echo "export JXAAS_URL=http://${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}:8080/xaas"

jxaas list-instances mysql

jxaas create-instance mysql m3

jxaas list-instances mysql
```


Eventually, this should move into the started state (you can also watch juju status).

Then you should try:

```
jxaas connect-instance mysql m3
```


If you're going to stop here, don't forget to shut down your EC2 instances.  But if you
go on to step 4 first, there's a nice feature that can use the setup you're got now...
