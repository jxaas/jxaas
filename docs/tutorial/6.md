## 6 - Metrics & logs!

This assumes you're still running the local LXC JXaaS, as in step 5

Deploy another mysql instance for us to play with:

```
jxaas create-instance mysql m1

jxaas list-instances mysql

# Coffee

jxaas list-properties mysql m1 db
jxaas connect mysql m1

```

You can see the juju logs from your instance (this currently only works for LXC):

```
jxaas list-log mysql m1
```

You can also inspect some metrics:

```
# List available metrics
jxaas list-metrics mysql m1

# Query metrics
jxaas get-metric mysql m1 Load1Min
jxaas get-metric mysql m1 Load5Min
jxaas get-metric mysql m1 Load15Min
```

The metric _system_ is quite sophisticated: we capture metrics using Heka (a lightweight
metric collection system from Mozilla written in Go) and write them straight into ElasticSearch.  But
right now we just don't expose that many metrics!!

We have kibana installed, which allows browsing & searching of the metrics being logged, although
typically this is only for development and you'll access metrics through jxaas.  When Kibana opens,
choose the 'Sample Dashboard' for people that are not using Logstash (since we're using heka instead):

```
KIBANA_ADDRESS=`juju status kibana | grep public-address | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
echo "KIBANA_ADDRESS=${KIBANA_ADDRESS}"
x-www-browser http://${KIBANA_ADDRESS}/
```
