## 6 - Metrics & logs!

This assumes you're still running the local LXC JXaaS, as in step 5

Deploy another mysql instance for us to play with:

```
jxaas create-instance mysql m1

jxaas list-instances mysql

# Coffee

jxaas list-properties mysql m1 db
jxaas connect mysql m1

```

You can see the juju logs from your instance (this currently only works for LXC):

```
jxaas list-log mysql m1
```

You can also inspect some metrics:

```
bin/jxaas get-metric mysql m1 Load1Min
bin/jxaas get-metric mysql m1 Load5Min
bin/jxaas get-metric mysql m1 Load15Min
```

The metric _system_ is quite sophisticated: we capture metrics using Heka (a lightweight
metric collection system from Mozilla written in Go) and write them straight into ElasticSearch.  But
right now we just don't expose that many metrics!!
