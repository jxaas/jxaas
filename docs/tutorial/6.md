## 6 - Metrics & logs!

This step assumes you're still running the local LXC JXaaS, as in step 5

Deploy another mysql instance for us to play with:

```
jxaas create-instance mysql tutorial6

jxaas wait mysql tutorial6

jxaas list-instances mysql
jxaas list-properties mysql tutorial6 mysql
jxaas connect mysql tutorial6
```

You can see the juju logs from your instance (this currently only works for LXC):

```
jxaas list-log mysql tutorial6
```

You can also inspect some metrics:

```
# List available metrics
jxaas list-metrics mysql tutorial6

# Query metrics
jxaas get-metric mysql tutorial6 Load1Min
jxaas get-metric mysql tutorial6 Load5Min
jxaas get-metric mysql tutorial6 Load15Min
```

The metric _system_ is quite sophisticated: we capture metrics using Heka (a lightweight
metric collection system from Mozilla written in Go) and write them straight into ElasticSearch.  But
right now we just don't expose that many metrics!!

We have kibana installed, which allows browsing & searching of the metrics being logged, although
typically this is only for development and you'll access metrics through jxaas.  When Kibana opens,
choose the 'Sample Dashboard' for people that are not using Logstash (since we're using heka instead):

```
KIBANA_ADDRESS=`juju status kibana | grep public-address | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
echo "KIBANA_ADDRESS=${KIBANA_ADDRESS}"
x-www-browser http://${KIBANA_ADDRESS}/
```
