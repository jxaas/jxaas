## 5 - More services!

JXaaS makes it really easy to take a Juju charm, and create an XaaS.  You just have [write a manifest](../manifest.md).

Let's look at some other services that ship with JXaaS.

We'll switch back to running locally, with LXC.  Let's start with a clean Juju install (note that this will wipe your Juju):

```
juju destroy-environment local

juju init
juju switch local
juju bootstrap
juju status
```

Let's install JXaaS using the ready-built charm:

```
juju deploy cs:~justin-fathomdb/trusty/jxaas jxaas
```

Configure JXaaS with the Juju credentials:

```
API_SECRET=`grep admin-secret ~/.juju/environments/local.jenv | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
echo "API_SECRET=${API_SECRET}"
juju set jxaas api-password=${API_SECRET}
```

And open JXaaS to the world:

```
juju expose jxaas
```

Let's try it out (this is a little more complicated than it was when we were running JXaaS on the host machine):

```
PUBLIC_ADDRESS=`juju status jxaas | grep public-address | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
echo "PUBLIC_ADDRESS is ${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}"
export JXAAS_URL=http://${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}:8080/xaas
echo "export JXAAS_URL=http://${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}:8080/xaas"

jxaas list-instances mysql
```


### Postgres

```
jxaas create-instance pg pg5

jxaas list-instances pg
```

Once it is ready:

```
sudo apt-get install --yes postgresql-client

jxaas connect-instance pg pg5
```


### MongoDB

```
jxaas create-instance mongodb mongodb5

jxaas list-instances mongodb
```

Once it is ready:

```
sudo apt-get install --yes mongodb-clients

jxaas connect-instance mongodb mongodb5
```

### Multi-tenant MySQL

Multi-tenant mysql creates instances as part of a shared MySQL instance.

It allocates each instance its own database, rather than a whole database server.

You will notice that this is much faster; it doesn't have to launch a new instance
or install much additional software.  For the second instance, it doesn't have to install _any_
additional software!

```
jxaas create-instance multimysql mm5

jxaas list-instances multimysql
```

Once it is ready:

```
jxaas list-properties multimysql mm5 db
jxaas connect multimysql mm5
```

# Summary

JXaaS makes it easy to take a charm and make it an XaaS.  We saw a number of services that ship with JXaaS.
