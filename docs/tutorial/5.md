## 5 - More services!

We'll now switch back to running locally, via LXC.

Let's start with a clean Juju install (note that this will wipe your Juju)

```
juju init
juju switch local
juju bootstrap
juju status
```

You can't add JXaaS to machine #0 on LXC, so:

```
juju deploy cs:~justin-fathomdb/trusty/jxaas jxaas
```

```
API_SECRET=`grep admin-secret ~/.juju/environments/local.jenv | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
echo "API_SECRET=${API_SECRET}"
juju set jxaas api-password=${API_SECRET}
```

```
juju expose jxaas
```

```
PUBLIC_ADDRESS=`juju status jxaas | grep public-address | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr -d ' '`
echo "PUBLIC_ADDRESS is ${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}"
export JXAAS_URL=http://${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}:8080/xaas
echo "export JXAAS_URL=http://${PUBLIC_ADDRESS}:8080/xaas"

jxaas list-instances mysql
```


### Postgres

```
jxaas create-instance pg pg5

jxaas list-instances pg
```

Once it is ready:

```
jxaas connect-instance pg pg5
```

### MongoDB

```
jxaas create-instance mongodb mongodb5

jxaas list-instances mongodb
```


Once it is ready:

```
jxaas connect-instance mongodb mongodb5
```

### Multi-tenant MySQL

Multi-tenant mysql creates instances as part of a shared MySQL instance.

It allocates each instance its own database, rather than a whole database server.

You will notice that this is much faster; it doesn't have to launch a new instance
or install much additional software.  For the second instance, it doesn't have to install _any_
additional software!

```
jxaas create-instance multimysql mm5

jxaas list-instances multimysql
```


Once it is ready:
```
jxaas list-properties multimysql mm5 db
jxaas connect multimysql mm5
```
